Implement macros for asm
  Set up compiler to generate a temporary file with includes/macros taken care of
    First pass (Macro finder)
      take out macro definitions and store
      when coming across an #include, look for macros in that too
    Second pass (preprocessor)
      echo contents, replace #include with file contents
      replace macro invocations with code
      save file as <filename>.gen
    Third pass (compiler)
      Current run, minus the #include stuff

  maybe refactor assembler to be extensible...
      Would check for .macro word at start
      Would look for .endmacro for end
      Target \# for arguments
      Calling would be (<name>,arg1,arg2,arg3)
      ex macro:
        .macro <name>
          SET PUSH, \1
          SET \1, [\2]
        .endmacro
      Simple text replacement
Implement #includes for asm
  - Ignore already included files ( set at beginning of parse to avoid recursive includes )
Implement dat arrays  dat [<size>]
